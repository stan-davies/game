- Records score
- Has ability to broadcast messages given a flag
- Flag corresponds to a specific string (use some switch case)
- For example, game over (display score)
- Could also record high score and add "new high score" to message when
  appropriate
- I am imagining it takes over the screen using some background and foreground
  stuff
